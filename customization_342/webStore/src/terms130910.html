<p><strong>1. Terms</strong></p><p>1.1 These terms and conditions set out the basis on which Conversant Limited ("we", "our" or "us") provides telephone and other services (the "services") together with related goods including all such goods described in invoices issued by us to you ("goods") to our customers ("you" or "your").</p><p>1.2 Additional terms may apply to your use of some of the services or the provision of goods by us. If so, we will tell you what those terms are ("additional terms"). If there is any conflict between these terms and any additional terms, the additional terms will prevail.</p><p><strong>2. Services</strong></p><p>2.1 We are not obliged to provide the services unless we accept your application. We can decide whether or not to accept any application.</p><p>2.2 We will use all reasonable endeavours to make the services available to you at all times. If the services are unavailable for any reason we will endeavour to restore service as soon as possible.</p><p>2.3 While we take reasonable security precautions, due to the nature of telecommunications services we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any calls or transmissions you make using the services.</p><p>2.4 We can suspend or restrict the services at any time if:</p><ul><li>we consider it necessary to protect or maintain the services; or</li><li>we believe that you have breached any of our terms and conditions.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Goods</strong></p><p>3.1 The purchase price is for goods supplied and packed, and is exclusive of installation and maintenance.</p><p>3.2 Where we agree to transport the goods to a specified place, we will deliver, or arrange delivery of, the goods to that place.

Should a Service Outage span more than one month, the calculation of Service Credits starts again at the beginning of each month.</p><p>13.6 Service Credits will be issued in the form of a credit towards your next invoice, unless the affected month is your last month of subscription to the Affected Services, in which case the dollar value of the Service Credits, as calculated herein, will be issued to you by us within 60 calendar days from the end of your last month of subscription to the Services.</p><p>13.7 Service Credits will apply only to your users directly affected by a Service Outage, and Service Credits may not exceed 100% of the total subscription fees of the Affected Services, excluding applicable taxes. Service Credits will not be issued for any fraction of an Outage Unit and will not accrue or carry over from month to month. Notwithstanding anything set out in this agreement, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service Credits described in this clause 13 shall be your sole and exclusive remedy in connection with any outages, unavailability or breach by us of this agreement, in relation to the telephone services.</p><p><strong>14.

We will respond to a support request in relation to a telephone service within the timeframes and in the manner set out in these terms.</p><p>14.2 We will attempt to resolve a support request as quickly as reasonably possible, taking into account the priority assigned to the problem. When appropriate, we will try to give an estimate of how long a problem may take to resolve. We will keep you informed of our progress in resolving the problem.</p><p>14.3 In the course of solving a problem we may issue you with a workaround which will enable you to continue working (albeit with possibly reduced functionality).</p><p>14.4 You may request support during the support hours by either:</p><ul><li>Calling the Conversant help desk. The appropriate telephone number is listed on our website;</li><li>Emailing the help desk.

In addition, we will attempt to resolve a support request in relation to telephone services within the support hours set out in Table One.</p><p>Table One</p><table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"><tbody><tr><th>Priority</th><th>Response time</th><th>Target resolution time</th></tr><tr><th>P1</th><td>30 support minutes</td><td>2 support hours</td></tr><tr><th>P2</th><td>8 support hours</td><td>5 support days</td></tr><tr><th>P3</th><td>2 support days</td><td>10 support days</td></tr></tbody></table><p>14.7 For the purposes of this clause "respond" means to make reasonable attempts to communicate to the individual requesting support that we have commenced attempting to resolve the issue.</p><p>14.8 For the purposes of this clause:</p><ul><li>P1 means an issue that is causing loss of availability of a telephone service as defined in paragraph 13.2; </li><li>P2 means an issue that is affecting your ability to use the features of any telephone service; and </li><li>P3 means an issue that is affecting your ability to access or use others aspects of the services incidental to or not directly related to the telephone service.</li></ul><p>14.9 For the purposes of this clause "resolve" means to remedy the fault reported by the user.
