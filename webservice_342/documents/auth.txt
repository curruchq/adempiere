Authentication
--------------
- Login to ADempiere using username/password

Authorization
-------------
- WebServiceType -> Role(s) -> User(s)
	* A web service type is created (readSubscription-Public), a role is created (Web Service - Public Role), user(s) are assigned to this role.
- Add "Authorization" tab
	* This will control level of access for a single user. 
	* Each record will be made up of the following columns
		RoleId (is this needed?)
		UserId
		ParameterName
		Value (a regex expression)
		
	



Notes:
- Does role layer complicate things? How many "groups" of users will their be within users using public web services?
